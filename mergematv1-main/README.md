# mergematv1

Hi all welcome to the mergemat env

currently the frontend and backend codespaces have been initialized, please fork this project and then clone, once any changes have been made you can then raise a PULL request which will be reviewed
and then merged to respective feature branches, please do not pull directly to the main branch of this repository to keep it error free and stable.

For the frontend, all Dev dependencies have been added to the package.json file

```
this has been created using npx create-react-app

```
To initialize the server please navigate to your local directory through your terminal (preferably BASH) and run:

```
npm start
```
Frontend changes to be made on the app.js file, though you would have to create additional components which will be called by this file,

lastly to access the server type in any browser of your choice

```
http://localhost:3000/

```
